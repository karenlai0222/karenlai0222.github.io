I am a bioinformatics scientist at a non-profit organization. This is a place where I write notes about what I've learned and used along the way for wrangling and analyses of high-throughput sequencing data. I'll also put notes/materials that I used to train scientists who have little computational/bioinformatics experience. Notes here can be random, and I don't mean to write like I am a super expert in the field.  

The main purposes here are two: (1) to serve as notes for myself (just like the name indicated), and (2) hopefully people who are also learning in the field can find something here helpful.
